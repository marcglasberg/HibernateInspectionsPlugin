This inspection reports when an embeddable class subclasses another embeddable class
(both annotated with @Embeddable).

    What happens when an embeddable class subclasses another embeddable class?
    Only the direct fields of the exact subclass declared in the entity that contains the component (the embeddable object) will be persisted.
    Also, the component creation may silently fail when loading the entity that contains the component (Hibernate will set it to null).
