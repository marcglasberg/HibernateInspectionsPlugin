This inspection reports when a persisted class is final
(persisted with Hibernate or similar, annotated with @Entity, @MappedSuperclass, or @Embeddable).
<p>
    From the Hibernate documentation:

<blockquote>
    <i>
        A central feature of Hibernate, proxies (lazy loading), depends upon the persistent class being either non-final,
        or the implementation of an interface that declares all public methods.
        You can persist final classes that do not implement an interface with Hibernate; you will not, however,
        be able to use proxies for lazy association fetching which will ultimately limit your options for performance tuning.
    </i>
</blockquote>

<p>
    There are 3 ways to solve this:
    <br>
    • First is not to declare the class final.
    <br>• Second is to disable proxy generation:
<blockquote>
    <pre>@Entity @Proxy(lazy=false) public class Cat { ... }</pre>
</blockquote>
• Third is to tell Hibernate to use the interface instead (possible only when the final class implements a proper "full" interface):
<blockquote>
<pre>@Entity @Proxy(proxyClass=ICat.class) public class Cat implements ICat { ... }</pre>
</blockquote>
